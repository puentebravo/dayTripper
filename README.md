# dayTripper

A simple, interactive day planner for blocking out time during 0900-1700 regular business hours.

## Description

DayTripper is a lightweight, easy to use daily planner app that allows busy professionals the ability to see their hourly tasks, reminders, and deliverables during a regular 9-5 workday. DayTripper uses JQUERY, JSON, Bootstrap, dynamically rendered, and Luxon's time library HTML to easily inform the user what timeblock they're currently in, what's coming up, and which events have already elapsed.

## Features

- Dynamically updated: rows shift color to indicate past, present, and future based on your local time, and the current date is displayed at the very top of the page to get you started on the right track

- Persistant: quick loading, locally stored data means your tasks are there until you decide to overwrite them, much like a virtual whiteboard.

- Lightweight: Daytripper is optimized to load and run easily no matter what system you're running.

## Installation

DayTripper is available to clone for personal use, or for deployment to any local intranet.
